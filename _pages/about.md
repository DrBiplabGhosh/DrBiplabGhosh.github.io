<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p align= "justify">
My name is Biplab Ghosh and I am PDM Research Scholar at the Roeffaers's lab of KU Leuven, Belgium. <Br> 
Currently I am working on the nanoscale degradation mechanism in lead halide perovskite-based optoelectronic devices under external stimuli. <Br> 
In parallel, I am working on the development of lead-free halide perovskites (you know the toxicity of lead). 

This website contains information about my research. Check the contact page for the contact information.
